# LinkedIn Auto Resume Downloader

This program automates the process of downloading applicant resumes from LinkedIn job application notification emails via the **Gmail API**. It's designed for recruiters who receive email notifications from LinkedIn when candidates apply.

It intelligently organizes downloaded resumes into separate folders based on the specific job posting, making it easier to manage applications for multiple roles. Additionally, it maintains an Excel file (`log.xlsx`) as a comprehensive record of all downloaded resumes, including details like the email's reception date and the associated job post.

## Features

*   **Automated Resume Download:** Fetches resumes directly from LinkedIn application emails.
*   **Job-Specific Folder Organization:** Sorts and saves resumes into dedicated folders for each job posting (e.g., `Downloaded_Resumes/Software_Engineer`).
*   **Download Log:** Maintains an `log.xlsx` file with a record of every downloaded resume.
*   **Resume from Last Run:** Can automatically pick up from the last download session to ensure no resumes are missed.
*   **Customizable Date Range:** Allows specifying a start and end date/time for resume retrieval.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Designed to gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and variations in email formats.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Python 3.x:** Installed on your local machine.
2.  **LinkedIn Email Notifications:** As a recruiter, you must be receiving email notifications from `jobs-listings@linkedin.com` every time someone applies to a job post.
3.  **Google Cloud Project & Gmail API:**
    *   Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Enable the **Gmail API** for your project.
    *   Create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** credentials (select "Desktop app" as the application type) and download the `client_secret.json` file. Rename it if necessary, but keep it as `client_secret.json`. This file must be placed in the root directory of your project.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-auto-resume-downloader.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd linkedin-auto-resume-downloader
    ```
2.  **Place `client_secret.json`:**
    Move the `client_secret.json` file you downloaded from Google Cloud Console into the root of this project directory.
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python linkedin_downloader.py
    ```

2.  **Initial Authorization:**
    *   The first time you run the script, a browser window will open, prompting you to authorize the application to access your Gmail account. Make sure you are logged in with the Google account that receives LinkedIn job application emails.
    *   Upon successful authorization, a `token.pickle` file will be created in your project directory. This file stores your credentials securely for future runs, so you won't need to re-authorize unless the token expires or is revoked.

3.  **Input Date Range:**
    *   The script will then ask for a **Start Date** and **End Date** in the format `dd mm yyyy hh` (e.g., `01 01 2023 00` for January 1st, 2023, 12 AM).
    *   **Start Date:**
        *   If left empty, the script will automatically use the end date of its previous successful run (stored in `info.txt`) to ensure continuity.
        *   If no `info.txt` exists or is empty, you *must* provide a start date.
    *   **End Date:**
        *   If left empty, the script will default to the current date and time.
    *   **Timezone:** The script uses `Asia/Kolkata` as the default timezone. You can easily change this by modifying the `TIMEZONE` constant at the top of the `linkedin_downloader.py` file to your desired timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`).

4.  **Download Process:**
    *   The script will fetch LinkedIn job application emails within the specified date range.
    *   Resumes will be downloaded into the `Downloaded_Resumes` folder, organized into subfolders named after the job postings.
    *   A `log.xlsx` file will be created or updated with details of each downloaded resume.

## Project Structure

After running the script, your project directory will look similar to this:

```
